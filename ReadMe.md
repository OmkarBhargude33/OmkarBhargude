## Projects

### Customised Virtual File System (CVFS)  :-

- This project is a custom implementation of a Virtual File System (VFS) that simulates the core functionality of the Linux file system.
- It is built entirely in C, with its own custom shell to interact with the virtual environment.
- The project provides a practical understanding of system calls, file handling, memory management, and OS internals.

### Generalised Data Structure Library

- The Generalised Data Structure Library is a reusable C++ library that provides object-oriented implementations of both linear and non-linear data structures.
- It offers ready-to-use functionalities for fundamental as well as advanced operations, designed in a generic way using C++ templates so they can be reused with any data type.
- The library follows clean OOP principles, emphasizing modularity, extensibility, and reusability, making it ideal for both academic learning and real-world application development.

### FilePacker-Unpacker

- A Java-based file utility tool that allows packing multiple files into a single archive and unpacking them back with all metadata preserved.
- To enhance security, the packed file is encrypted, and only authorized users can decrypt and extract the data.
- The project also features a Swing-based GUI for easy and user-friendly interaction.
